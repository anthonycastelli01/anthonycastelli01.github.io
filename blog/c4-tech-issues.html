          <h1>Issues in the Tech World</h1>
          <h2>Designing for Accessibility</h2>

        <p>I feel strange talking about issues in the tech world, because we've been so focused these past few weeks on how great and useful tech is. One of the great things we have learned about is the freedom (for better or worse) that CSS gives us in placing and formatting things on web pages. While it's definitely an option to do just about whatever you want, there are some things you should and shouldn't do if you want a useful site. This is where web design and layout comes into play. You don't want your site to have a fundamentally bad layout that's hard to navigate or where it's hard to find the information you need.</p>

        <p>Element colors also play a big part in the way people perceive your site. There's a huge selection of colors that can be selected from when working on a webpage, and some may go together really well and many don't look good at all. However, there's something many people may not think about when building a webpage. Imagine you've spent all day working on a project for a Christmas-themed website, and you're especially proud of the color scheme. The site is decorated all over with candy cane imagery, the buttons all have a holly theme, and you got the words to line up just right with the borders. At the end of the day, you submit the final page to your supervisor with a feeling of success and pride.</p>

        <p>The next day, you come in to work to find that he absolutely hates it! You ask what you did wrong that made him feel that way, and he responds that he can't even read half the page! He's green/red colorblind and all of your fancy buttons and borders appear as blobs to him! While the candy cane portions aren't an issue, you made all of the navigation buttons have a green background with red text, which just shows up as one indeterminate rectangle for him.</p>

        <p>It's for reasons like colorblindness that it's important to take in website color schemes seriously. When we design for a huge audience, it's easy to forget that not everyone can perceive the internet in the same way we do. While it can be easy to fix a color scheme, it might not be such an easy fix if you need to make the page accessible to blind people, or those who can't use a mouse. This may not be a common problem for most developers, but large corporations like Amazon and Facebook do need to worry about their customers with accessibility problems.</p>
