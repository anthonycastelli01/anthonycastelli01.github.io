        The fireside chat video confirmed what I had been hearing about DBC's curriculum, about how the instructors are willing to teach you, but in order to excel you have to put in as much as you want to get out. My impression of DBC so far is that it's a place for people who all share the common goal of wanting to code for a living to come together and collaborate in order to get up to speed with other developers. Overall, my expectations haven't really changed after this video, but I'm definitely more excited!

        I'm both excited and nervous to start putting in the effort to get things done and learn more about how the world of development works. I can see myself arriving for class and being nervous in class and during coding sessions, just because that's how I always feel in new situations. It has always taken me a while to warm up to new experiences but once I get comfortable it's hard to get me away.

        This week, my biggest challenge was getting to the point where I could remember the whole process of pushing code while not overriding DBC's master branch. I was pretty nervous that something would go wrong and I'd mess something up! However, it was exciting to learn to work with git in a way that I had never used it before. I haven't quite worked on the time boxing techniques I wanted to try, just because this week has been a little hectic and I had to work on code at odd hours.
