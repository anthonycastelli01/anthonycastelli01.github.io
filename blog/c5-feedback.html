        <h3>Pairing</h3>
        <p>Overall, pairing has been much better than I expected. My past experiences of coding with someone else there haven't been that great, but these challenges, where only one person has a specific task, has been much more enjoyable and organized. I really like the simplicity of one person doing the typing and one person looking everything up and providing extra guidance. It allows for each person to have a say in what's happening, and to feel like they're really contributing to the coding process. I think so far the most annoying thing has been having to use Google Hangounts, because it cuts out so frequently.</p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>So far, I've felt pretty good about the feedback I've received. I don't know if it was necessarily helpful for <i>learning</i>, but it was nice to hear people responding positively to the way I have been in pairing sessions. I think overall I have mostly gotten feedback about how it's been nice to have someone who knows what they're doing and is also willing to talk alound about the thought process gone through when coding. I had some trouble giving feedback in the beginning because I would always just want to put "good job! keep up the good work!" but I needed to really put something useful in there. I want to do a good job and help people out when they finish pairing, but I also feel like I'm a terrible writer and my comments are pretty bland.</p>
