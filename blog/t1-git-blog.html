          <h1>Version Control and GitHub</h1>
          <h2>A very useful way to keep track of your projects!</h2>

        <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
        <p>
          Version control benefits developers by allowing projects to be worked on by many people at the same time with minimal conflicts. It also provides a nice way for the group to decide on changes to the overall structure and the form of the project before releasing it to the world. It does this by keeping track of all the changes made by each contributor and when they took place. Later on, these changes can be merged into a main section of code from the copies the team members were working on. This main segment is called the master branch and it is what gets shared to the world.

        <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
        <p>
          Git is version control software that allows for commits, which are sort of like save points in video games. A project can be reverted back to any of these points whenever necessary, so is a mistake is made the code can be switched back to a working version. These changes are all kept no matter how many there are, so you can keep track of any and all changes that occur.

        <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
        <p>
          For starters, GitHub is an online place to store code, which means that if you forget the computer you were working on but want to continue coding, you can pull it down from the web instead of being stuck. GitHub is also a great community and allows others to see and proofread your code, so that you aren't working in a vacuum.
